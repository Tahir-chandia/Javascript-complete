/* 5 phhases of5 Phase Or Pillars Of Dom Manipulation:
1. DOM (Document Object Model)
2. Selection Of HTML
3. HTML Manipulation (Changin the HTML)
4. CSS Manipulation (Changin the CSS)
5. Event Listeners (Event Handling)*/

//1. DOM (Document Object Model)

/* When a web page loaded, browser creates a document object model (DOM) of the page*/


/*Let's take a deep dive:
* The html page gets converted into the DOM (a big javascript-like object structure named "Document")
*Because of that, everything on the page — buttons, headings, images — becomes an
object with properties and methods.

❑ That's why you can do things like:
❖ querySelector("h1") ➔ to find an element.
❖ addEventListener("click", ...) ➔ to listen for user actions.
❖ innerHTML = “Mai hun manas" ➔ to change content.

Without the DOM, JavaScript wouldn't know what’s on the page, and we couldn’t control it so easily

In short:
HTML ➔ DOM ➔ JavaScript controls the DOM like objects.

Note1:
❑ Document object is available inside
window object.

Note2:
❑ If your <script> is in the <head>, the browser runs the
JavaScript before it finishes loading the <body>. In that
case, document Elements you are trying to access are null.


What Is NodeList?

A NodeList is a simple list of DOM elements or collection of nodes (DOM elements) you got from the webpage, but it’s not a full real array.
